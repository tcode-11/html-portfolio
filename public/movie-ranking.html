<h2>My Top 3 Movies I Have Watched This Year</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Lord of the Rings</h3>
<p>
This movie is so dynamic that it was really fun to watch!<br />
Each story is deeply connected to each other, so you cannot even miss a single story.<br />
</p>

<h3>Firebird</h3>
<p>I watched Firebird in winter, and I felt I wanted to find someone that is meant to be bonded together.<br />
Even though both characters wished to be together, the time and society tore them apart,<br />
 which made me so sad. I really recommend this movie for those who believe true love.

<h3>Love, Simon</h3>
<p>In this movie, common things are depicted that young gay people struggle with in their childhood.<br />
One high school boy in the movie is thought to be just an ordinary straight, but he actually isn't.<br />
He starts messaging an unknown guy online and slowly falling love with him.
